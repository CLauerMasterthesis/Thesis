# Masterthesis: Feedback-WatchApp Christian Lauer

This is a WatchKit-Project for an Apple Watch based Feedbacksystem prototype.
Feedback Systems should support the user with the process of energy saving by transmitting them information about their energy usage as well as visualizing this information.
Purpose of this project is to show how Feedbacksystem can be applied in a Watch-App.
The whole sample code is included. The following gives an overview of which functions have been implemented.
