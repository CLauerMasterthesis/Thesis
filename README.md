# Masterthesis: Feedback-WatchApp Christian Lauer

This is a WatchKit-Project for an Apple Watch based Feedback System prototype.
Feedback Systems should support the user with the process of energy saving by transmitting them information about their energy usage as well as visualizing this information.
The purpose of this project is to show how Feedback Systems can be applied in a Watch-App.
The whole sample code is included. This Github repository gives an overview of which functions have been implemented.

Overview:

1. Showing historical and comparsion data (Text and Images) within the main View:
